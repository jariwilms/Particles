# Particles
Simulate millions of particles simultaneously

## Properties
* Allocates an OpenGL vertex buffer which is shared by OpenCL
* OpenCL kernels calculate particle position every frame
* No data is moved after initial setup (if energy is disabled), which gives significantly improved performance

## Performance
Computer specs:  
CPU: Ryzen 5 2600  
GPU: GTX 1060 6GB  

The table below shows the average framerate for a given particle count.

|  Particles | Framerate |  Frametime | Energy? |
|:----------:|:---------:|:----------:|:-------:|
|    100 000 |   1370.69 |     0.73ms |      no |
|    100 000 |    359.85 |     2.78ms |     yes |
|  1 000 000 |    413.63 |     2.42ms |      no |
|  1 000 000 |     64.97 |    15.39ms |     yes |
|  3 000 000 |    155.32 |     6.44ms |      no |
|  3 000 000 |     26.87 |    37.22ms |     yes |
|  5 000 000 |     98.61 |    10.14ms |      no |
| 10 000 000 |     52.32 |    19.11ms |      no |

As you can see, moving data between the CPU and GPU causes a large performance loss, even for small amounts.
